# Content Management Systems
## By MJ



A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

In simpler language, a content management system is a tool that helps you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing images, and other functions, the content management system handles all that basic infrastructure stuff for you so that you can focus on more forward-facing parts of your website.

It's like if you know Libraries/Frameworks like React , Vue etc. , you only focus developing the container which will contain your content.

### Best Platforms which i prefer for CMS are :
- [Microsoft's Sharepoint](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiUvN7Irsb6AhXYcGwGHWkbBngQFnoECCYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw0KPr-vH8YdxextK-vhRRUG)
- [Wordpress (Best for Beginners)](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjf_Z7brsb6AhUemGYCHVS0AVcYABABGgJzbQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_34UHBlIPqvfh78H3OWoj0o2Tn4WA&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwix6Jjbrsb6AhVGT2wGHTf0CVcQ0Qx6BAgFEAE)
- [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/)/[Wix](https://www.wix.com/) (Good alternatives to Wordpress)

> CMS is not here to replace or kill Web Development; rather, it is an addition to civilian developers (those who aren't full-stack devs or don't understand it) so that they can focus more on the site's design and content.
