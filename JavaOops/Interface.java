//Interfaces are used in Java to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
//It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
//Interface cannot be final otherwise it thow compile time error
//In Interface only one specifier is used- Public.
//In an interface, you canâ€™t instantiate variables and create an object.
//The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public and static.
//From Java 9 onwards, interfaces can contain the following also:

//static methods
//Private methods
//Private Static methods
