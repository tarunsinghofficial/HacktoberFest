# FileCompression-Project-DS
What is this project about?

This project is about Building an application for Text File Compression using Huffman Coding. Given a a text file as an input, 
this app will compress the file and then save the file with reduced size. You can also decompress the file using this app into 
its original form. This app also has some additional features such as: Given a string of alphabetic characters, you can compress 
the size of its bit sequence to obtain a binary sequence that has size significantly lesser than the original, this new sequence 
then can be sent through a network or saved in file so that it can be decompressed whenever required.

How it will run, how does it work?

In order to run the application, first step is to download all the project files in this branch and then put them in an appropriate folder.
We have provided an executable .jar as well as .exe file inside the folder named "Executable" in which you will find files named "EncodorGUI.jar" and "Encoder.exe".
You can click on any one of these to execute the application. (There is also an alternative way to execute the project, you can open the project in any IDE and execute 
the main method inside the class "EncoderGUI").
Upon opening the application you will be given an option to browse a file and select it. After you have selected your file, choose the location where you want to 
save the compressed file. After you have done all these steps you can hit the "Compress" Button to compress your file. For further detailed instructions on how the 
project works, you can refer to the following video:
