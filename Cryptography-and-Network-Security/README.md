Implement Caesar and Hill cipher. Both are substitution cipher. Analyze the strength
of the cipher in terms of brute force attack and cryptanalysis attack.
Suggest one way to improve and strengthen the cipher and analyze with respect to cryptanalysis attack.
<br>
Ceasar cipher-
<br>
Your plaintext is Hello, Welcome. The key used is 3. How Ceaser cipher will work?
<br>
Test case :
<br>
A B C
<br>
D E F
<br>
Hill Cipher - 
<br>

        [ 17 17 5]    
    K = [ 21 18 5]    
        [ 2  2  19]       

Plaintext = pay
<br>
Ciphertext = RRL

Implement Euclid algorithm to find GCD.
<br>
GCD(16,12) = 4
<br>
GCD(12,4) = 0
<br>
Then 4 is the GCD(16,12) 

### 7. [ Euler‚Äôs totient](https://github.com/anujvaghani0/Cryptography-and-Network-Security/blob/main/eulersTotient.java)

<br>
Take two prime numbers p, q
<br>
n=pxq
<br>
Initially take encryption key such that it is relatively prime with —Ñ(n).
<br>
Find out decryption key.
<br>
Take plaintext message M, Ciphertext C=Me mod n.
<br>
To get plaintect from ciphertext M=Cd mod n.
<br>
Test case :
<br>
Two prime numbers 17,11
<br>
Encryption key = 7
<br>
Decryption key = 23
<br>
M=88,
C=11
