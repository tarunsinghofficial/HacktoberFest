# Linear-Regression-model-of-Pre-owned-Cars-data

Let's take a look at a Linear Regression model analysing the dataset of a Pre-Owned Car's dataset.
1. Thoroughly analyse the dataset of preowned cars using Regression in Machine Learning.
2. Firstly the raw dataset is processed, then adjustments, OLS Assumptions and significance of the model are found. Then the dummy variables are dealt with and various analytical predictions are done using the model.
3. Dealing with log transformations, multicollinearity and creating dummy variables. Then the Linear regression model is created by splitting the dataset into train and test and then analysing the results.
